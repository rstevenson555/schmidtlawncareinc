					<h1>FAQ's:</h1>

					<div class="question">What is the average cost to plow a driveway?</div>
					<div class="answer">Most residential driveways are $40 per visit. Front public sidewalks are typically $10 (corner house, or larger lots will cost more).  Sidewalks  
          From driveway to front door are typically only $10. ($40 minimum charge per visit / 1-4" snow fall) </div>

					<div class="question">Can you shovel or snow blow my driveway instead of using a snow plow?</div>
					<div class="answer">We do offer shoveling/snow blowing of driveways. The cost is typically 50% higher.</div>

					<div class="question">What type of snow plows do you use?</div>
					<div class="answer">We use plows with a steel edge for the best snow removal results.</div>

					<div class="question">What happens if the snow storm last all day long?</div>
					<div class="answer">If a snow storm is long lasting or extremely heavy we may need to clear your property more than one 
          time during a given storm, resulting in additional plowing charge (Quoted prices are for the typical 1-4" snow fall).</div>

					
                    <div class="question">What happens during a Blizzard?</div> 
                    <div class="answer">As soon as the main roads are drivable we will be able to service your property. 
                        Driveways are the priority, all sidewalks will be cleaned after the storm is over. This process will likely take multiple days to complete. 
                        We will make sure the entrance to your driveway is kept clean throughout the blizzard. Your price quoted for snow services 
                        are for the typical 1”-4” of accumulation. For example, if we receive 20” of snow fall, 
                        your cost could be up to five (5) times your regular rate. </div>  

                    <div class="question">When do you plow and or shovel my property?</div>
					<div class="answer">We will make our best effort to time our services with the end of a storm. However, we try to clear your 
          driveway and/or sidewalks prior to 6:00 am and/or 6:00 pm for your convenience.  </div>

					<div class="question">What if I have cars parked in my driveway?</div>
					<div class="answer">We do not plow next to or pass along side of a car parked in driveway. However if you are a shovel/snow 
          blower type customer there is no problem or extra charge.   </div>
                    
                    <!-- -->
                    <div class="question">Why do we start snow management services at 1”</div>
					<div class="answer">Many snow storms are less than 2”. If we receive multiple snow falls of less than two inches you will   
          have excess snow on driveway and sidewalks that will get packed down and made very slippery.</div>
                    
                    <div class="question">Can you apply salt to my driveway and/or sidewalks?</div>
					<div class="answer">Yes we carry Calcium Chloride on all of our plow trucks. Calcium Chloride is the best de-icing product 
          we have found to help avoid damage to lawns,shrubs,driveways, sidewalks, and buildings. The minimum  
          charge is $45 and typically covers driveway and all sidewalks. ($45 charge is based on us being on site doing snow removal)</div>
                    
                    <div class="question">Can you de-ice my property without plowing?</div>
					<div class="answer">The minimum charge for applying Calcium Chloride without snow plowing or shoveling is $75</div>
                    
                    <div class="question">"How do I make payments?</div>
					<div class="answer">You will be invoiced bi-weekly for the services performed at your property.  Payments are due upon receipt of invoice.</div>
                    
                    <div class="question">How can I get in touch with you if I have a snow related question or request?</div>
					<div class="answer">I can be reached by phone, email or text. My cell number is 630.878.8447 email is AL@SCHMIDTLAWNCAREINC.COM</div>
