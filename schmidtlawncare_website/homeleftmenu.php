					title="A Spring Clean-up is the initial clean-up of any leaves or landscape debris that has
					accumulated over the winter months.  It is always a good idea to clean-up
					any debris and make room for healthy new growth of turf, shrubs, and
					perennials.  Spring Clean-ups are preformed as soon as the Winter weather breaks and are
					usually completed by the first week of April.">Spring Cleanup</span>

					title="Core aeration removes tiny plugs of soil from the lawn to reduce the
					compaction that stifles root growth.  The plugs quickly break down naturally
					to provide natural reduction of thatch.  It also provides effective channels for
					fertilizer, water, and oxygen to reach and activate the roots for optimum growth.
					Aeration is a great time to over seed the lawn to encourage a thick beautiful
					turf.  For best results, follow the aeration with an overseed in the Spring, we
					use only the finest professional seed mixtures. Spring aeration is completed during
					the months of April and May.  Fall aerations begin mid August through October
					1st">Spring/Fall Aeration</span>

					title="Power raking aggressively removes the thatch from the lawn to allow
					oxygen and water to penetrate the surface of the ground.  Much like an
					aeration, power raking can help to improve the overall health of the
					lawn.  Power raking is done through the summer season, for best results
					we reccomend a power rake and overseed service in the
					Spring">Power Raking/De-thatch</span>

					title="Shrub trimming is important to the overall health of the plant and 
					should be done at least once a year to avoid over growth.  We are constantly
					sharpening our trimmers to ensure the healthiest and cleanest cuts.  After
					trimming we clean-up and haul away all the associated
					debris.  Spring trimming is suggested during the months of May and June,
					depending on species and growth.  Fall trimming is suggested throughout the
					month of September.">Spring/Fall Shrub Trimming</span>

					title="Mulch serves many purposes, it is esthetically pleasing, it inhibits 
					weed growth, it adds nutrients to the soil that benefit the plants, and
					it helps to keep plants moist during the long hot days of summer.  Mulch
					can also help prevent soil erosion.  There are various types of mulch and
					they range in cost based on material availability.  The overall recommended
					mulch depth is 3” on average.  Mulch is a natural product that breaks down
					over time.">Mulch</span>

					title="Our mowing service is preformed weekly from the first week of April 
					until the last week of October.  We use commercial grade machines that leave
					the lawn looking professionally groomed.  We sharpen our blades every ten
					hours or less to keep the cut fresh and healthy.  Dull blades can tear the
					grass and expose your lawn to disease and fungus.  We also steam clean our
					machines on a weekly basis to limit any disease or fungus transfers.  We
					string trim all the areas the mower can not reach and then blow all hard
					surfaces clean.  We can bag the grass clippings and debris for a nominal
					debris removal charge.  Regular mowing begins approximately April 1st and
					continues until the begining of November.  Fall mowing to collect leaves
					off the turf is done by request only, unless you are a regular debris removal
					customer.">Mowing</span>

					title="We can smooth out your bumpy lawn or correct drainage issues by
					re-grading or leveling your lawn.  We can also connect your downspouts
					and/or sump pump discharge lines to an under drain to solve wet and
					consistently soggy spots.">Grading/Leveling</span>

					title="A Fall Clean-up service is special treat to you and your lawn.
					With our fall clean-up we will remove any remaining dead annuals, cut
					back dead perennials, blow all landscape debris from your landscaped
					beds and patio areas.  We then focus on cleaning the turf of all leaves,
					sticks, and debris.  This service leaves your lawn looking fantastic.
					Did you know leaves left on the turf throughout the Winter can change the
					acidity of your soil and cause for unhealthy turf in the Spring and
					Summer?">Fall Clean-up</span>
