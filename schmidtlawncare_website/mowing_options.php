                    <div class="question">1.  Weekly mowing no bagging.  </div><div class="answer">Your lawn will be cut on a weekly basis as needed.  We will alternate the direction
                    of cutting each week to help relieve stress to the turf.  Areas where the mower will not reach will be trimmed with
                    a line trimmer as needed.  All hard surfaces will be blown clean after every mowing.</div>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <div class="question">2.  Weekly mowing w/bagging.  </div><div class="answer">With this service your grass will be bagged all year long giving your property
                    a professionally manicured look.  Fall leaves on the turf will be bagged and removed during the weekly mowing
                    process.  The cost for this service is your weekly mowing charge plus $5 per can of debris removed from turf.</div>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <div class="question">3.  Double cut no bagging.  </div><div class="answer">If your lawn is excessively tall we can make two passes over your lawn with our
                    mowers to reduce the size of the clippings.  We will only double cut the areas that need it and you will be charged
                    accordingly.  The cost for this type of service is typically only $5 for the front yard & $5 for the backyard. 
                    Please call for exact pricing for your property.</div>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <div class="question">4.  Selective bagging.  </div><div class="answer">We can bag just your back or front yard if needed.  Or if you are having a party and
                    want your lawn bagged just for that day, call a week in advance and let me know.  The cost for this service
                    is your weekly mowing charge plus $5 per can of debris removed from turf.</div>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    <div class="question">5.  Fall mowing with debris removal (October-November).  </div><div class="answer">If you are not a regular weekly cut and bag customer and
                    want your leaves removed from the turf on a weekly basis, this service is what you want.  Starting in October
                    we will start bagging your lawn as soon as the leaves start to fall.  You will be invoiced 
                    for the total amount cans removed from your turf.  The cost for this service is your weekly mowing charge 
                    plus $5 per can of debris removed from turf.</div>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    *Our cans typically hold 1 1/2 times the amount of a regular yard waste bag.
